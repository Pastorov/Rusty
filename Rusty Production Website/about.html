        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>We are a 3 person team making a game show called Rust Death Maze. The team was created at the end of 2020, 
            but the 4-person team left 2 people who ambitiously continued the project. The main idea behind rusty 
            production is to show how funny a death maze is in motion with the right people and good editing. 
            When it comes to how the Death Maze works, it is the players who have to go through several stages. 
            But each stage will have 3 choices, which 1 of them can safely go to the next stage, but if the player 
            chooses wrong, he may die immediately.</p>

                <h1>Rusty Production the Best Death Maze in Rust.</h1>
                <p>The name of this project is ‘Primazia’ as it serves to affiliate with Amazon’s Prime subscription model as well
                     as encompassing aspects of a Maze. The maze will exist within a video game environment and will not feature a 
                     roof, so a camera can follow the contestants as they travel through the maze from a ‘bird’s eye’ perspective. Each time a decision needs to be made by a contestant within the maze, the viewer will receive an on-screen prompt for choice of A, B and C for the respective doors. Similar to how on the gameshow The Chase (ITV, 2020) features an on-screen prompt for the three available choices for the viewers. One door will lead to certain death, another will be a survivable encounter to then pick 
                    another choice and the third choice will be the correct door to which the contestant can progress to the next section.
                    Death Maze in Rust is a lot of fun, but also requires a lot of work. 
                    That's why our man Harrison Wood is the right person for it. He has a lot of experience building servers and maps in Rust.
                     Harrison knows exactly how to set up all the traps and keep everything working as it should.</p>
